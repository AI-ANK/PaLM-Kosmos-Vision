# PaLM-Kosmos-Vision

PaLM-Kosmos-Vision is an innovative web application that combines the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to describe images and engage users in detailed conversations about those images. This project showcases the integration of PaLM API for nuanced language understanding and the KOSMOS-2 model for generating image captions.

## Features

- Image upload functionality with real-time display.
- Automatic image captioning using the KOSMOS-2 model.
- Detailed chat interactions about images powered by PaLM API.
- Session-based chat history with a clear chat option.
- Demo version includes a message count limit feature.

## Tech Stack

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) as the web app framework.
- [PaLM](https://github.com/google-research/palm) and [KOSMOS-2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lucataco/kosmos-2) models for AI functionalities.
- [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) for model deployment and serving.
- [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/llama-index/llama-index) for efficient LLM orchestration.
- Python libraries such as `requests`, `Pillow`, `transformers`.

## Setup and Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary Python packages. Ensure to set up API keys for Google Cloud and Replicate as environment variables before running the application.

## Usage

Start the app with Streamlit and upload an image to begin. The interface allows for interactive conversations about the image, with the app providing contextually relevant information.
